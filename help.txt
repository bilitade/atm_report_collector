see ,  i want to copy the file in the  LOGS_FOLDER  path , 
there might be more than one file not just only log.txt file. 
I want you to copy the whole file in the folder if they do
 not exist in to destination folder. and if the  file already exists
  in the destination folder  I want you to only pick only new   or unique  basically  based on their filename 
 for  illustration  
file structure  of  source 
   \\10.1.15.77/ ejlogs/  
                         2023-11-06_FINFINE_TEST_EJDATA1.txt
                         2023-11-06_FINFINE_TEST_EJDATA1.txt
                         2023-11-06_FINFINE_TEST_EJDATA1.txt
file structure of  destination
C:\ATMLogs\ATM-Dembel-CBO23424

also dont forget that it should create the destination folder specific to that atm 
 if  folder is not created and if it   it exist , check if the file already exist  ,if not copy the file to the destination
